pipeSurfaceProfile.m can be used to modify the surface profile of a pipe mesh generated using genGridPipe.m.
The profile is loaded from a csv for both the inner and outer surfaces. The profile has nz columns and nc rows.
The profile may be given as a deviation from the original surface or defined as a radius at each location.

The algorithm loops through each (nz,nc) position and modifies the node positions. The maximum deformation of 
elements can be set and controls the number of elements that must be modified to make the surface to conform to
the desired profile. For each surface point the deformed elements are deformed by the same amount. If the number
of elements that must be deformed to create both surfaces is more than the total number of elements through the
wall thickness an error is thrown. 

This process minimises the number of elements which must be deformed to generate the surface. This reduces the 
number of unique element stiffness values that pogo must store and therefore reduces the memory required for 
the model.
