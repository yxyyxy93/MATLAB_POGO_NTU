function [m] = pogoRampFilterSource(m, p, whichSig, whichShot)
%Add a ramp filter to a Pogo source (indicated by whichSig and whichShot)
%
% [m] = pogoRampFilterSource(m, p, whichSig, whichShot)
%
%m - model to operate on
%p - power - what power to raise the frequency to
%whichSig - which signal to filter
%whichShot - which shot to filter
